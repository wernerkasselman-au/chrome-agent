//! Managed Chromes that no session entry claims.
//!
//! `sessions.json` is the only list this tool consults, and a browser leaves that list
//! for reasons that have nothing to do with whether it is running: `close` removes the
//! entry whether or not the kill landed, the relaunch path removes it before spawning a
//! replacement, `prune`/`cleanup_stale` drop entries whose pid reads as dead, and the
//! file itself can be rewritten by a newer version. Every one of those leaves a Chrome
//! holding a profile directory with nothing left pointing at it — invisible to `status`,
//! unreachable by `close`, and alive until the machine reboots. Two were measured at 19
//! days on a developer machine, next to five the registry still knew about.
//!
//! The profile sweep behind `close --purge-orphans` (`profiles.rs`) is the disk half of
//! the same idea and deliberately stays that way: it deletes directories, never signals
//! a process. This module is the process half, and it recognises its own browsers the
//! only way that survives the registry being wrong — by the `--user-data-dir` they were
//! launched with, which points inside this tool's own `browsers/` directory.
