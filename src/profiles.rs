//! Removal of browser profile directories that nothing owns any more.
//!
//! A profile is created by `launch_browser` and deleted only by `close --purge`. An
//! agent that omits the flag, or crashes, leaves ~14 MB behind for good — and the
//! session-store prune makes that worse, not better: it drops the entry as soon as the
//! browser's pid is gone, so the directory loses the only name anything knew it by.
//! Measured on a developer machine: `browsers/` held 1204 directories totalling 24.98 GB
//! against 3 entries in the store.
//!
//! The predicate is three-condition and every condition fails towards keeping, because
//! the two outcomes are not comparable: keeping an abandoned profile costs bytes, while
//! deleting a live one destroys whatever that browser is logged into.
