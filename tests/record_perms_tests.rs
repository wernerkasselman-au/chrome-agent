//! A recording is as sensitive as the session it recorded.
//!
//! A pipe command carrying `_record` writes it and its response to that file, which
//! includes the values
//! that passed through a fill — among them the ones redacted on stdout precisely because
//! they are secrets. Screenshot, pdf, download and the session store all chmod 0600; the
//! recording was created with whatever the umask allowed, typically 0644, world-readable on
//! a shared machine.
