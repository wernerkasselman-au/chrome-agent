//! The read-back is evidence whichever verb performed it.
//!
//! `fill` reports `changed / value_kept` on a fresh session: the read on the handle it wrote to
//! is measured on this action's own target, so it stands whether or not the page could be
//! compared (rung 11 of the ladder in `src/verdict.rs`). `select` and `check`/`uncheck` perform
//! the same measurement — they set a state, dispatch, wait through `READ_BACK_MS` and re-read —
//! and used to report the window and nothing else, so the classifier saw no postcondition at
//! all and answered `unknown / no_baseline` for an action whose own target had been measured.
//!
//! Same class of evidence honoured for one verb and discarded for two others is the asymmetry
//! the verdict module exists to remove, so these tests compare the three verbs directly rather
//! than asserting a literal per verb.
